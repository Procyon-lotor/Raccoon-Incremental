        <h2>Version 0 (Initial Development)</h2>
        <h3>v0.5</h3>
        <p>- Added an Achievements tab</p>
        <p>- Added some info text and an XP bar that fills up as XP is earned</p>
        <p>- Added the first achievement to the game (it's working but the code for this is a little messy, so I might need to fix some things)</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>v0.4</h3>
        <p>- Added the first two upgrades of the game</p>
        <p>- Added a Points per second display</p>
        <p>- Created an array so that more upgrades can be added</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>v0.3</h3>
        <p>- Set up the UI so that all main tabs are on a sidebar</p>
        <p>- Added a Settings page</p>
        <p>- Added an Autosave feature with adjustable intervals as well as a manual save button for people who are anxious about saving like me</p>
        <p>- Added a Hard Reset button</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>v0.2</h3>
        <p>- Edited changelog text so now when you scroll it doesn't overlap with the header and description</p>
        <p>- Added save function so players retain their score after closing or refreshing the tab</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>v0.1</h3>
        <p>- Changed the background to blue (more specifically, #1f2f3f)</p>
        <p>- Added buttons that take you to the changelog and back to the main game</p>
        <p>- Changed the font to Roboto</p>
        <p>- Tried to add a modal so clicking on the changelog wouldn't stop progress but it didn't work (it also didn't break my code so I'm not playing around with it anymore)</p>
        <p>- Added the first steps of UI, including changing some buttons and formatting some text</p>
        <p>- Removed the Flask server because it was a hassle and I found a simpler way to work around it</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>v0.0</h3>
        <p>- Started development! Here we go...</p>
        <p>- Installed Flask server so progress can be saved</p>
        <p>- Managed to create a button that increments a score by 1 each time you click it</p>
