    <!-- Changelog Title -->
    <h1 id="changelog-header">Changelog</h1>
    <h1 id="changelog-description">Changes are listed by version in the form vA.B.(C), where A denotes huge changes, B denotes small changes, and C denotes changes that do not alter gameplay (e.g., clarification of in-game text).</h1>

    <!-- Changelog Content -->
    <div class="changelog-content">
        <h2>Version 0 (Initial Development)</h2>
        <h3>v0.2</h3>
        <p>- Edited changelog text so now when you scroll it doesn't overlap with the header and description</p>
        <p>- Added save function so players retain their score after closing or refreshing the tab</p>
        <h3>v0.1</h3>
        <p>- Changed the background to blue (more specifically, #1f2f3f)</p>
        <p>- Added buttons that take you to the changelog and back to the main game</p>
        <p>- Changed the font to Roboto</p>
        <p>- Tried to add a modal so clicking on the changelog wouldn't stop progress but it didn't work (it also didn't break my code so I'm not playing around with it anymore)</p>
        <p>- Added the first steps of UI, including changing some buttons and formatting some text</p>
        <p>- Removed the Flask server because it was a hassle and I found a simpler way to work around it</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h3>v0.0</h3>
        <p>- Started development! Here we go...</p>
        <p>- Installed Flask server so progress can be saved</p>
        <p>- Managed to create a button that increments a score by 1 each time you click it</p>
